One may wish to open an account and simultaneously deposit some initial amount. Although the initial implementation did not address this requirement, it can be achieved by using an initializer.

 class account_with_deposit x =
    object
      inherit account_with_history
      initializer balance <- x
    end;;

class account_with_deposit :
  Euro.c ->
  object
    val mutable balance : Euro.c
    val mutable history : Euro.c operation list
    method balance : Euro.c
    method deposit : Euro.c -> unit
    method history : Euro.c operation list
    method private trace : Euro.c operation -> unit
    method withdraw : Euro.c -> Euro.c
  end

A better alternative is:

 class account_with_deposit x =
    object (self)
      inherit account_with_history
      initializer self#deposit x
    end;;

class account_with_deposit :
  Euro.c ->
  object
    val mutable balance : Euro.c
    val mutable history : Euro.c operation list
    method balance : Euro.c
    method deposit : Euro.c -> unit
    method history : Euro.c operation list
    method private trace : Euro.c operation -> unit
    method withdraw : Euro.c -> Euro.c
  end
